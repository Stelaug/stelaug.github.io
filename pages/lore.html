        Anders Tale, a young creature with great hopes and dreams.
        <br>He's not the talkative type, but he wants everyone well. Unfortunately, Anders learns that those who stand out will face strong opposition.

        <br>Anders therefore takes the matter into his own hands, and after countless unsuccessful attempts, he finally feels he has found a permanent solution. Anders gets his revenge, he is blinded by hatred and blinded by grief and insists that the world will fall to its knees under his relentless anger, he has fought for a world that did not want him, he is now determined that the world will burn .

        <br>But Anders quickly learns that he is not omnipotent, lightning flashes and thunder wrecks over Scandinavia. By the elegance of the Northern Lights and the relentless cold of the North Wind, Anders is forced to his knees. He was awakened from his slumber.

        <br>He stopped Anders, and he must regret letting Anders live.

        <br>Anders will walk through biting cold, warmed by a fiery hatred. Fight through the fire of Hell, cooled by a frozen heart.
        <br>Anders will force the Devil to his knees, and steal Its powers to meet Him.

        <br>Anders will get his revenge, covered in armor and plates, armed with firepower enough to disgrace even the strongest armies or with a clenched fist and armored with the hatred of the mind, no matter what, Anders Tale's odyssey will end toe to toe against Him.
