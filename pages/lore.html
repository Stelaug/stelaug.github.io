        Anders Tale, a young being filled with hopes and dreams.
        <br>Though not of the talkative type, he's always wished others well.

        <br>Sadly, Anders quickly learns that those who stand out, will be left out.
        <br>Anders, not one to admit defeat so fast, takes matters into his own hands.
        <br>He tries timeagain, yet, to no avail.
        <br>But after countless attempts, he believes to have found a solution.
        <br>Cold, bitter revenge.
        <br>Now, blinded by anger and grief, he sees the world in a new light.
        <br>Anders is now hellbent on bringing the world to its knees.
        <br>He fought for a world that did not welcome him, but now, their time to suffer has come.
        <br>With an iron will and determination, he shall ensure the world is devoured by flames.

        <br>But soon thereafter, Anders must realize he is not omnipitent.
        <br>Lightning splits the heavens and a terrible thunder roars over Scandinavia,
        <br>with an elegance like the Northern Lights and as relentless as the bitter cold,
        <br>Anders is forced to his knees, his newfound dream shatters. 
        <br>Without a warning, <i>He</i> has awakened from <i>His</i> slumber.
        <br><i>He</i> stopped Anders, and <i>He</i> must pay for that.
        <br>Anders will make sure <i>He</i> regrets letting him live.

        <br>Anders will wander through biting cold, warmed by nothing but his burning hatred.
        <br>Walk through the fires of Hell, cooled by nothing but his ice-cold heart.
        <br>Anders will force <i>It</i> to their knees, claim <i>It's</i> power as his own, and use it to battle <i>Him</i>.
        <br>Anders will get his revenge, armoured from head to toe, armed with the firepower to put the worlds strongest armies to shame, 
        <br>or armed with nothing but his legs, and protected only by his burning wrath. 
        <br>It does not matter. Anders Tale's journey can only end toe to toe against <i>Him</i>.
