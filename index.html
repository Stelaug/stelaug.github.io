                    But the other kids bullied Anders, because he was different.<br>
                    But Anders was never one to give up, he chose to do something about it.<br>
                    <br>
                    After hearing of the incident, God became furious! He swore to bring the Heavens Wrath upon Anders.<br>
                    But there was one thing God had not yet realised.<br>
                    <br>
                    God is not the way.<br>
                    And Anders will show him.</p>
